      "code": "../code_sections/ownership.rs",
      "details":"In Rust, some simple types are \"implicitly copyable\" and when you assign them or pass them as arguments, the receiver will get a copy, leaving the original value in place. These types do not require allocation to copy and do not have finalizers (i.e. they do not contain owned boxes or implement Drop), so the compiler considers them cheap and safe to copy. For other types copies must be made explicitly, by convention implementing the Clone trait and calling the clone method, so in the above example, if we didn't clone the variable, we cannot use the token id again in the contract nft approve method, as it will be consumed in the contract nft mint method, if you want to know more about the ownership and how th rust is dealing with memory check this <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html\">link!</a>"

Instead of passing objects by value (T), objects can be passed by reference (&T).\n\nThe compiler statically guarantees (via its borrow checker) that references always point to valid objects. That is, while references to an object exist, the object cannot be destroyed. for more details check this <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/borrow.html\">link!</a>"
